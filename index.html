        <h2>CC3: Does Chile have a crucial role in the global energy transition?</h2>
        <p> 
            Chile's strategic mineral reserves position it as a <strong>critical supplier for global energy transition</strong>, controlling significant copper and lithium resources essential for clean technologies.
            Copper mine production by country shows Chile as the <strong>world's largest mined copper producer</strong> (~5M tonnes a year, representing 21% of global production in 2025).
        </p>
    </div>
    <figure id="Location6"></figure>
    <p> 
        Furthermore, lithium production by country positioned Chile as the <strong>second-largest lithium producer</strong> (25% of global production in 2023)
    </p>
    <figure id="Location7"></figure>
    <p>
        <strong>Takeaways:</strong>
        Chile has a crucial role to play in the global energy transition, dominating two critical energy transition minerals, copper for electrical infrastructure and lithium for batteries, <strong>cementing its role as indispensable to global decarbonization efforts.</strong>

        <h2>CC4: Improving a graph </h2>
        <h3>Original Graph</h3>
        <p>
        The original graph uses two tricks to exaggerate Chile's economic performance. First, it shows Chile in isolation—without peer comparisons, any upward trajectory looks impressive. Second, it uses a linear scale, which visually inflates recent growth into a dramatic spike. A logarithmic scale is the proper choice for comparing growth rates, as equal distances represent equal percentage growth. When corrected, Chile's "miracle" looks far more modest.
        </p>

        <h3>Replic of the original graph</h3>
        <figure id="Location9"></figure>
        <h3>New graph version</h3>
        <p>
        This chart adds context with four peers. South Korea started poorer than Chile in 1970 yet achieved 12× growth—proving far more dramatic transformations were possible. Argentina, richer in 1970, stagnated at 1.5× growth. Spain and Portugal, with similar democratic transitions, achieved 2.7× growth via EU integration. Chile's 3× growth outpaced Latin America but fell short of Asian tigers and only slightly exceeded Southern Europe.
The improved visualization uses a logarithmic scale, adds peer comparisons and removes distracting imagery.

    <h2>CC5: Accessing data - Scraper and API</h2>
            <figure id="Location10"></figure>
     <h3>World Bank API - Functional Description</h3>
        <p>
            The World Bank API uses the base URL <code>https://api.worldbank.org/v2/</code> followed by the endpoint structure <code>/country/{country_codes}/indicator/{indicator_code}</code>. Country codes are ISO-3 codes separated by semicolons (e.g., <code>WLD;EUU;NAC</code> for World, European Union, and North America). The indicator code specifies which dataset to retrieve (e.g., <code>EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS</code> for renewable energy consumption). Query parameters include <code>format=json</code> for JSON output, <code>per_page</code> to set the number of records, and <code>date</code> for the year range (e.g., <code>1990:2022</code>). The full URL used in the chart is:
        </p>
        <pre><code>https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/WLD;EUU;NAC;EAS;LCN;SSF/indicator/EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS?format=json&per_page=500&date=1990:2022</code></pre>
        <p>
            Note that the API returns a two-element array where index <code>[0]</code> contains metadata and index <code>[1]</code> contains the actual data, so in Vega-Lite you must use <code>"format": {"property": "[1]"}</code> to extract the data correctly.
